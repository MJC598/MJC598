## Hi there 👋

My name is Matthew Carroll and currently I'm a software engineer researcher for the Syndemics Lab at Boston Medical Center.

### Interests

Currently, my interests are in applied biological computation and mathematics. I am really interested in biological modeling and how to make the lives of others better. I'm exploring potential PhD opportunities both in the US and abroad so that I can eventually chair my own research lab. Specifically, I'm intrigued by modeling the interplay of neurons and the spread of communicable diseases. I have a bit of experience in applying ML models for predictive neuroscience and have spent the last three years working in modeling opioid use disorder and related communicable diseases as part of the department of infectious diseases here at Boston Medical.

Outside work, I enjoy reading and volunteering with the Prison Book Program so that I can continue to propogate learning to everyone as I believe education is the key to a healthy life and society.

### Works

Currently my main role is as a Research Software Engineer II at the Syndemics Lab. I've been a part of numerous different publications focusing on decision science (with my focus on the software implementation) and have given oral presentations at conferences such as SMDM. 

Outside the Syndemics Lab, I am part of the Open Source Modeling SIG (Special Interest Group) with SMDM and a member of the Association for Computing Machinery. As part of OSM I am currently reviewing the quality of open source modeling repositories for decision science as well as working on a potential SBIR grant opportunity.
